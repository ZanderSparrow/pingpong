# Ping Pong

#### _A JavaScript code review for Epicodus Intro to Programming_

#### By _**Sondra Silverhawk**_

## Description

_This fourth code review is a demonstration of JavaScript loops, conditionals, and variables. The user inputs a number, and the page then counts to that number, starting at one, but replaces numbers divisible by three with ping, numbers divisible by five with pong, and numbers divisible by both three and five with ping-pong. This website is submitted for code review, Epicodus evening Intro to Programming 2015_

## Setup

* _User will be asked how high they would like to count to._ 
* _Once the user submits a number, the count is displayed on the webpage, with certain numbers (multiples three or five) replaced with ping and/or pong._
* _Please visit [my gh_pages site](http://zandersparrow.github.io/pingpong/ "gh-pages site for pingpong repository")_
* _The code is available in my pingpong repository on GitHub, handle ZanderSparrow_
